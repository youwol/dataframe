 * In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma)

 * A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; high
 * standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.
 *
 * The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution
 * is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust
 * than the average absolute deviation. A useful property of standard deviation is that, unlike
 * variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.

 * In mathematics, the root mean square (abbreviated RMS or rms), also known as the quadratic mean,

 *
 * It can be calculated for a series of discrete values or for a continuously varying function.
 * The name comes from the fact that it is the square root of the mean of the squares of the values.
 * It is a special case of the generalized mean with the exponent p = 2.

 * between the upper and lower quartiles, `IQR = Q3 âˆ’ Q1`. In other words, the IQR
 * is the 1st Quartile subtracted from the 3rd Quartile; these quartiles can be clearly
 * seen on a box plot on the data. It is a trimmed estimator, defined as the 25% trimmed
 * mid-range, and is the most significant basic robust measure of scale.
